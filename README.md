# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

- When a user would like to favorite a message, the "Favorite" button can be clicked and will save the current message to a list of favorites. 
- User then can click "View Favorites" button to show the saved list of favorite affirmations and mantras. At any point a "Delete" button can be clicked below a message to delete the message above it. User can then navigate back to main page by clicking "Back to Main Page" button and can continue adding to list of favorites if desired.
